          <h2>System Overview</h2>

          <div class="textbox">

            <h3>1. Initialization</h3>
            <p>
              The program starts with an initialization where the user inputs their custom 
              parameters. Then, the system starts the simulation,  creating web servers and
              requests to be fulfilled.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Arrivals</h3>
            <p>
              For each cycle, a random number of requests arrives. While there
              are still requests to be fulfilled, they are checked to see if their IP is blocked, 
              then added to the queue if not blocked.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Queue</h3>
            <p>
              If the queue is not empty, and an idle server is available, the first request in the
              queue is assigned to a server. If an idle server isn't available, the request remains
              in the queue.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Servers</h3>
            <p>
              Each server is checked to see if the request has finished. If so, the request is removed
              from the server, and statistics are updated. If the request isn't finished, it remains on
              the server.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Scaling</h3>
            <p>
              The system changes the number of servers based on the number of tasks. If 
              <b>Queue > 80 * servers</b>, servers are added. if <b>Queue < 50 * servers</b>
              and more than one server exists, a server is removed.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Reporting</h3>
            <p>
              Performance metrics such as total processed requests, total servers utilized,
              and duration of time are reported.
            </p>
